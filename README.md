# Maya API Server

> OpenEBS exposes its APIs here

A service exposing `Kubernetes` like volume APIs.

## Use Cases

### Serving EBS compatibility

Maya api server has some similarity with Kubernetes with respect to latter's
volume provisioning methods. This makes it super simple for operators and admins
to get into the usage of OpenEBS without much of learning curve.

## Setting up maya api server locally

> These are some of the steps to start off with development & running of maya api 
server in one's laptop. It assumes use of Linux as laptop's OS. In addition, the 
laptop should have Virtual Box & Vagrant installed.

```bash
- git clone https://github.com/openebs/mayaserver.git
- cd to above cloned folder i.e mayaserver
  - vagrant up
  - vagrant ssh
- Inside the vagrant VM run below steps:
  - make init
  - make
  - make bin
  - sudo nohup m-apiserver up -bind=172.28.128.4 &>mapiserver.log &
```

### Troubleshooting during local setup

```bash
- `make init` is a time taking operation
  - This downloads all the vendoring libraries
  - Typically required for the very first attempt only
  - In case of add/update of new/existing vendoring libraries:
    - use `make sync` than `make init`
```

## Maya api server's exposed REST APIs

- `NOTE: Use the bind address on which your maya api server is running`

- Get InstanceID

  ```bash
    # Metadata
    $ curl http://172.28.128.4:5656/latest/meta-data/instance-id
  ```

- Volume provisioning & deletion requires the presence of orchestrator config file
  - It is a .INI formatted file
  - It should be located at `/etc/mayaserver/orchprovider/`
  - There can be multiple .INI files based on the number of `regions` the orchestrator is deployed/running
    - `/etc/mayaserver/orchprovider/nomad_global.INI`
    - `/etc/mayaserver/orchprovider/nomad_us-east-1.INI`
  - Each region based .INI file can be categorised into multiple datacenters
  - Maya api server works with following defaults:
    - `Nomad` as the default orchestrator &
    - `global` as Nomad's default region &
    - `dc1` as Nomad's default datacenter
  - Below is a sample .INI file that is valid for `Nomad` as maya api server's orchestrator

  ```ini
  [datacenter "dc1"]
  address = http://172.28.128.3:4646
  cn-type = host
  cn-network-cidr = 172.28.128.1/24
  cn-interface = enp0s8
  ```

- Below is a sample volume spec that can be provisioned

  ```yaml
  # Similar to K8s' PersistentVolumeClaim
  kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
  apiVersion: v1
  metadata:
    name: minjvol
  spec:
    accessModes:
      - ReadWriteOnce
    resources:
      requests:
        storage: 3G
  ```

  - NOTE - Verbose specs can be found at:
    - `lib/mockit/verbose_openebs_pvc.yaml`
    - json formatted: `lib/mockit/verbose_openebs_pvc.json`
  - Both json & yaml specs are supported when http request's Content-Type is `application/yaml`

- Sample REST Calls
 
  ```bash
  
  # Provision
  
  $ curl -k -H "Content-Type: application/yaml" \
    -XPOST -d"$(cat lib/mockit/minimal_openebs_pvc.yaml)" \
    http://172.28.128.4:5656/latest/volumes/

## Troubleshooting

- Verify the presence of maya api server binary
  - which m-apiserver
  - m-apiserver version

- Verify the presence of maya api server's orchestrator's .INI file(s)
  - i.e. /etc/mayaserver/orchprovider/nomad_global.INI
  - `global` is the name of the region

- Verify the contents of maya api server's orchestrator's .INI file

- Verify if maya api server is running as a process
  - Watch out for the process with 5656 as the port
  - `5656` is the default tcp port on which maya api server's services are exposed

  ```bash
  # Use netstat command
  $ netstat -tnlp

  (Not all processes could be identified, non-owned process info
   will not be shown, you would have to be root to see it all.)

- How to get the iscsi portal & iqn information of a iscsi based jiva volume ?
  - Info based REST API will fetch these information.
  - However, these will **not** be fetched in case of:
    - `error` or
    - `in-progress` / `pending` status
